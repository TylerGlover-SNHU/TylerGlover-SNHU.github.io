# Initial GitHub pages for Capstone project - CS-499

## Overview
This repository demonstrates my senior project for my undergraduate degree in Computer Science. The project focuses on machine learning topics involving the mnist database which contains hand written digits. An assignment was completed during an earlier class in which we trained a neural network using this data and experimented with a single parameter to observe its effect. This assignment is expended upon in this project. Further nueral network parameters are examined, and alternative machine learning algirthms were also analyzed. The best performing model was selected to develop a command line interface application that is capable of classifying hand written digits.

## Code Review
The project starts with a discussion of the existing code artifact that was enhanced. Possible improvements to the existing code are identified, and the planned enhancements are discussed in the following video.
